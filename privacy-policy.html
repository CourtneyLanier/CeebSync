    <h1>Privacy Policy for CeebSync</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> July 29, 2025<br>
    <strong>Last Updated:</strong> July 29, 2025</p>

    <p>At CeebSync, your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle the information you provide when using our services, including our AI-powered tools and integrations, such as the CeebSync Custom GPT.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>When you use our GPT assistant and related services, we may collect the following information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your Google account email address, if you connect via OAuth to access services like Google Docs or Sheets.</li>
        <li>User input, such as questions or prompts you submit to the assistant.</li>
        <li>Document content or metadata accessed via Google APIs, as necessary to fulfill your request.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information you provide solely for the purpose of completing the action you requested. This may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reading or editing content in a Google Doc or Sheet you’ve authorized.</li>
        <li>Creating new documents on your behalf.</li>
        <li>Performing custom workflows or automations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> use your data for marketing, analytics, or profiling.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
    <p>CeebSync does <strong>not</strong> store your personal data or document content on our servers. All data is processed in real time and discarded once the requested task is complete.</p>
    <p>We rely on secure, encrypted connections (e.g., HTTPS and OAuth 2.0) to handle your data safely during transfer.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties.</p>
    <p>The only services that may access your data are those you explicitly connect through OAuth (e.g., Google Workspace APIs), and those services handle your data according to their own privacy policies.</p>

    <h2>5. Your Control</h2>
    <p>You can revoke CeebSync’s access to your Google account at any time by visiting your <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions">Google Account Permissions</a> page.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. Continued use of the service constitutes acceptance of any changes.</p>
